            <h2>Every idea üí° starts with a need</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
            <h2>After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot</h2>
